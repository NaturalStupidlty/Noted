We want you to create a MVP for a personal note-taking application powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Think of gadgets like Humane AI Pin and https://www.omi.me/ as references.

### What Your MVP Should Include:
1. **Flexible Note Storage**: Your app should be able to save text notes in any format you choose. Here are a few examples of potential use-cases:
 * "_Dentist appointment on Monday at 10:00_"
 * "_Recipe for Sunday's pasta dinner:
8 cups of pasta (we used Farfalle)
12 cups of cold water
1 tablespoon of olive oil
1 tablespoon of sea salt or kosher salt
2 medium onions, diced
2 large garlic cloves, minced
1 tablespoon of Italian seasoning
..._"
* "_TODO: Check articles about LLMs with Memory_"
* "_#portuguese sorrir - to smile_"
2. **Quick Access to Recent Notes:** Ability to show the last N notes.
3. **Intuitive Natural Language Search:** Answer questions like:
* "_What plans do I have for this weekend?_"
* "_Show recent notes about LLM_"
* "_Portuguese words to learn_"

#### Optional Advanced Functionalities:
* automatically extract structured data (appointments, tasks, recipes, vocabulary) from notes.
* automatically classify or tag notes for easier retrieval and organization.
* any other ideas that could improve the UX

We understand the challenges of covering all the nuances in a limited timeframe. Thus, your initial focus should be on the essential functionalities: version one is always better than version none!
Feel free to use any tools, libs, and LLM providers. Start simple, but design with scalability in mind.

### Deliverables:
* A link to your GitHub repository containing the Python code.
* A brief description outlining your choice of tools and the overall architecture of the project.
* A link to live demo of your app or a demo video.

We're looking forward to seeing what you come up with.
